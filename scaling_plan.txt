Here's a brief plan outlining how to scale the solution to handle real-time data for multiple cryptocurrencies, leveraging Apache Iceberg for data storage:

1. Data Ingestion (Real-Time Stream):

    Replace requests with a Streaming Platform:
        Instead of polling the CoinGecko API periodically, use a streaming platform like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS Kinesis.
        Create a dedicated service that subscribes to real-time data feeds from CoinGecko (if available) or other cryptocurrency data providers.
        If direct feeds aren't available, implement a more efficient polling mechanism with asynchronous requests (e.g., asyncio in Python) and a message queue to handle rate limiting.
    Data Serialization:
        Serialize data in a compact and efficient format like Apache Avro, Protocol Buffers, or JSON with schema validation.
    Message Queue Topic Partitioning:
        Partition the message queue topics by cryptocurrency symbol to enable parallel processing.

2. Data Processing (Spark Streaming):

    Spark Streaming or Structured Streaming:
        Use Spark Streaming or Structured Streaming to process the real-time data stream.
        Implement windowing operations (e.g., tumbling windows, sliding windows) to calculate moving averages and other real-time metrics.
    Parallel Processing:
        Leverage Spark's distributed processing capabilities to handle multiple cryptocurrencies concurrently.
        Use Spark's partitioning and shuffling mechanisms to optimize data distribution and processing.
    State Management:
        For complex calculations or aggregations, use Spark's state management features to maintain state across streaming batches.

3. Data Storage (Apache Iceberg):

    Iceberg Partitioning:
        Partition the Iceberg tables by cryptocurrency symbol and date to improve query performance and data management.
    Iceberg Incremental Updates:
        Use Iceberg’s capabilities like row-level deletes and upserts, and merge-on-read to efficiently manage real-time updates.
    Iceberg Time Travel:
        Leverage Iceberg's time travel feature to easily query historical data and perform audits.
    Iceberg Data Retention Policies:
        Implement data retention policies using Iceberg’s snapshot management to manage storage costs and data lifecycle.
    Cloud Storage:
        Store the Iceberg tables on cloud storage like S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.
    Iceberg catalog:
        Use a proper catalog such as the AWS Glue catalog, or the Nessie catalog.

4. Real-Time Analytics and Visualization:

    Real-Time Dashboards:
        Use tools like Grafana, Tableau, or Power BI to create real-time dashboards that visualize cryptocurrency prices, moving averages, and other metrics.
    Streaming Queries:
        Use Spark SQL or other streaming query engines to perform real-time analytics on the data stream.
    Alerting System:
        Implement an alerting system that triggers notifications based on predefined thresholds or events (e.g., significant price changes, moving average crossovers).

5. Infrastructure and Scalability:

    Cloud-Based Infrastructure:
        Deploy the solution on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to leverage scalable infrastructure and managed services.
    Containerization:
        Use Docker and Kubernetes to containerize and orchestrate the different components of the solution.
    Auto-Scaling:
        Implement auto-scaling for Spark clusters and other services to handle fluctuating workloads.
    Monitoring and Logging:
        Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track system performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues.

6. API and Data Access:

    REST API:
        Create a REST API that allows users to access real-time and historical cryptocurrency data.
    Data Streaming API:
        Provide a data streaming API that allows users to subscribe to real-time data feeds.

Key Considerations:

    Data Accuracy and Reliability:
        Ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data sources.
        Implement data validation and quality checks.
    Latency:
        Minimize latency to provide real-time insights.
    Scalability and Performance:
        Design the solution to handle high volumes of data and traffic.
    Cost Optimization:
        Optimize resource utilization and storage costs.
    Security:
        Implement security measures to protect sensitive data.
    Schema Evolution:
        Iceberg handles schema evolution very well. This should be taken into account when designing the data pipelines.
    Data Consistency:
        Iceberg provides atomic commits, and snapshot isolation. This will ensure data consistency.
